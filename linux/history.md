**AT&T** had **Bell Labs**. **BL** developed **Unix** as universal **Multics** alternative.  
USA law forbid AT&T to get profit from Unix, but when BL was separated from  
AT&T, Unix became proprietary. To escape payments, other companies made  
*Unix-like* OSes, based on Unix ideas, not code. E.g. FreeBSD, evolved from  
Berkley Software Distribution - additional software for Unix.  
R. Stollman was disappointed with proprietary priter driver and started  
**GNU** project based on open-source.  
Linus Torvalds, disappointed with **Minix** (OS for students with restriction for  
modification) developed **Linux** kernel. Combined with **GNU** utilities it  
became what we now call **GNU/Linux**.
